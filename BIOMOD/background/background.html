  <p> <strong>Over the past decades, DNA’s sophisticated structure involving strict complementary base pairing has compelled an influx of scientists to participate in designing diverse DNA-based nanostructures. DNA has served as an excellent building material in versatile and state-of-the-art multidimensional nanostructures as a result of its sequence, programmability, accurate self-recognition, and instinct biocompatibility. Sticky-ended cohesion, cross-over junctions and blunt end stacking are predominantly adopted in constructing DNA-based structures. The representative examples of structural DNA nanotechnology include the formation of two-dimensional structures such as polygonal lattices<sup>1,2</sup>,periodic arrays<sup>3</sup> and helix bundles<sup>4</sup>,and three-dimension structures like prisms<sup>5</sup>, polyhedrons<sup>6</sup> and nanotubes<sup>7</sup>. (Figure 1).Moreover, DNA origami is especially worth mentioning as it contributes to the fabrication of many sophisticated nanoscale structures through staples fixing scaffold<sup>8,9</sup>. (Figure 2)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Considering its meticulous base pairing, DNA tends to self-assemble with high quality (e.g.: multilayer DNA origami can be made with high strand integration quality up to 99%.)<sup>10</sup>.Meanwhile, due to the non-covalent interactions between building blocks of DNA self-assembly, the defect which occurs during the assembly process can be filled to form the most stable conformation<sup>11</sup>. (Figure 3)  These advantages result in the formation of the aforementioned predictable and well-defined structures.  </strong></p>

<h1><strong>Figure 3. HS-AFM visualized (a) the self-error-correction and (b) the defects filling of DNA supramolecular structures. Adapted from ref 11.</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Despite the advantages of DNA nanotechnology, there remain a few challenges not limited to the high temperature needed in DNA hybridization, and the vulnerability of hydrogen bonds in DNA structures. Hybridization of single-stranded DNAs is typically used in the assembly of such structures, which requires denaturation at 95°C and long-time annealing. This excessively high temperature is fatal to some active molecules or enzymes, which are sometimes needed to co-assemble with the single-stranded DNAs in order to be loaded onto the surface or trapped inside. This indicates the difficulty of functionalization of the nanostructures. Thus, the applications of DNA nanostructures formed through hybridization are to some extent restricted. Drug delivery, for example, is hardly feasible in such systems, as drug molecules are often vulnerable at high temperature (e.g. Artemether and dihydroartemisinin were found to be very heat sensitive and began to decompose even at 60°C)<sup>12</sup>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Another limitation of such systems lies in their unstability, as is demonstrated by Robert Häner et. al. in their report<sup>13</sup>.(Figure 4) Supramolecular structures might disassemble at the change of solvent polarity. Considering the weak and reversible nature of base-pairing interactions utilized to hold the structure, they are often not robust enough to be useful in practical application<sup>14</sup>.</strong></p>

The thin sheets formed by hybridization of self-complementary tris-oligonucleotides disassembled when dissociated and dissolved in acetonitrile, while the covalently crosslinked sheets underwent transition into thick pads under the same condition, demonstrated by AFM. Adapted from ref 13.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</h1>
<p><strong>Recently, the work of Kim et. al. provided an alternative method of synthesizing nanostructures for better stability which does not entail high temperature(ref 14). Their team proposed a novel method to construct well-deﬁned nanostructures through self-assembly using an irreversible covalent bond, without the aid of preorganization or templates. A wide variety of nanostructures with diﬀerent levels of dimensions and complexity has been synthesized, including polymer nanocapsules<sup>15</sup>,2D polymers<sup>16</sup>, nanotubes, and microring<sup>17</sup>s.</strong></p>

<h1><strong>Figure 5. Formation mechanism of (a) the polymer nanocapsule (adapted from ref 15) (b) the 2D polymer (adapted from ref 16) and (c) the nanotube and microrings (adapted from ref 17).</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Compared with non-covalent self-assembly, using irreversible covalent bond does have some shortcomings. Since “self-error-correcting” is disabled, mistakenly formed bonds could not be corrected, which consequently leads to hyper branching or defects in nanostructures. Despite that, this approach produces nanostructures of much more stability, enabling them to be applied to more areas.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Using reversible covalent reactions (e.g. imine condensation, aldol reactions, and cycloadditions) might be another approach to generate nanostructures. By introducing dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC), chemists have already obtained cages at the molecular scale in good yields from rather simple precursors<sup>18</sup>. (Figure 6)  However, utilizing reversible covalent reactions to construct structures at nano-scale has been rarely reported.  </strong></p>

<h1><strong>Figure 6. A molecular cage 3 was formed from simple precursors 1 and 2, through reversible imine condensation reaction. Adapted from ref 18.</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The reversible covalent reaction might be a compromise of the two above, as it combines the error-correction capability of supramolecular chemistry and the robustness of covalent bonding<sup>19</sup>. This feature might help generate a nanostructure that is thermodynamically stable, and in the meantime robust enough to be put into applications, especially targeted drug delivery. In this case, there are still two more steps before practical application: target recognition and controlled release.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biotin-avidin interaction might be able to solve the former problem. Biotin is widely applied to biosystems as a small molecule that has a strong interaction with streptavidin, characterized by a formation (affinity) constant of （10^13）L/mo<sup>20</sup>l. Utilizing ureido moiety of biotin hydrogen bonding to five residues of streptavidin<sup>21</sup>(Figure 7), Nina Dassinger et. al. reported the immobilization of Concanavalin onto solid surfaces modified with biotin via a Concanavalin A–Streptavidin fusion protein<sup>22</sup>; Nicolas Aubrey et. al. reported the recognition of a scorpion toxin through a scFv /streptavidin-binding peptide fusion protein<sup>23</sup>. Besides, biotin’s exclusive characteristics enable biotin-avidin interaction to be widely used as an ideal general bridge system<sup>20</sup>.  First, Biotin is a small molecule (244.31 Da) which does not typically affect the biological activity of biologically active macromolecules. Furthermore, biotinylating becomes much easier due to the commercially available reagents and well-established procedures.  </strong></p>

<h1><strong>Figure 7. The hydrogen bonds between biotin and five residues of streptavidin. Adapted from ref 21. </strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I-motif structures might be able to solve the latter problem. i-motif structures, which are generally formed at slightly acidic pH, consist of two parallel-stranded C: C+ hemi-protonated base-paired duplexes<sup>24</sup>. The hydrogen bonds between two parallel strands insert antiparallel to each other to form four-stranded structures. I-motif structures are particularly amenable to widespread applications which need a response to environment<sup>25-27</sup>. (Figure 8)</strong></p>
